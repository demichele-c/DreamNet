## Tests

To test DreamNet using Insomnia, start by ensuring your server is running with npm start or node server.js. Open Insomnia and create new requests for each of the API endpoints, such as /api/users/login, /api/users/logout, /api/dreams, and /api/interpretations. For each endpoint, set the appropriate HTTP method (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE), include necessary headers (like Content-Type: application/json), and provide request body data as needed. Execute the requests to verify that they return the expected responses and interact correctly with your server. Inspect the returned data to ensure it matches your application's functionality and handle any errors or discrepancies as they arise.
